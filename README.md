# k3s-on-proxmox-vm-via-terraform-and-ansible
Scrafi's sh*tty terraform plan (with ansible playbook) to create and configure x proxmox vms with k3s installed as the master on the first node and as a worker on every other vm created by this plan.

!! Please only use this repo as inspiration to build your own terraform plan, since I build this specific for my use case !!
